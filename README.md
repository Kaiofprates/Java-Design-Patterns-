| Patterns | Description |
|:---------:|:-------------
Strategy |   Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, place them in separate classes, and make their objects interchangeable. |
|Composite |Composite is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects in tree structures and then work with those structures as if they were individual objects.
|Builder | The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is one of the Gang of Four design patterns|
| Fluent Interface | In software engineering, a fluent interface is an object-oriented API whose design relies extensively on method chaining. Its goal is to increase code legibility by creating a domain-specific language (DSL)|
|Factory | In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor|
|Singleton | In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton|
| Template | In object-oriented programming, the template method is one of the behavioral design patterns identified by Gamma et al.[1] in the book Design Patterns. The template method is a method in a superclass, usually an abstract superclass, and defines the skeleton of an operation in terms of a number of high-level steps. These steps are themselves implemented by additional helper methods in the same class as the template method|
